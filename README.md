## How to run it

From the root of this repo, run:

```bash
make zombies

So long as you've got Python 3.8 or newer, this should work without any
dependencies outside the standard library. If you particularly feel like
running the tests, you can set that up with `make test`. This is going to
assume you're somewhere with permissions to install dependencies; I'd recommend
setting this up in a virtual environment of some description.
