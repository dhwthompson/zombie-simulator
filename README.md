# Zombie simulator

## What it does

It simulates zombies!

Well, it doesn't do a whole lot of that *just* yet. It generates a grid
populated with people, some of whom are zombies and wish nothing more than to
feast on the living. They just don't know how to move yet, or feast, or even
perceive the humans. I'll get there.

## How to run it

From the root of this repo, run:

```bash
npm install
npx .
```


## Why JavaScript?

Because I haven't written any JavaScript in a good long while – I've been in
the Python and Ruby worlds most of the time – and I'd like to get back up to
speed and figure out what some of the new bits and pieces are about. Starting
with Node and `npm` and so forth, then perhaps throwing this into a browser
once I need some higher-fidelity graphics (read: pixels on a page,
rather than columns in a terminal).
