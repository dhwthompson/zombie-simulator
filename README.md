# Zombie simulator

## What it does

It simulates zombies!

Well, it doesn't do a whole lot of that *just* yet. It generates a grid
populated with people, some of whom are zombies and wish nothing more than to
feast on the living. The people don't know how to run away yet, so it's more of
a buffet than an apocalypse.
